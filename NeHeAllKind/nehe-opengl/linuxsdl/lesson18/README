Compilation:

make

Running:

./lesson18

Requirements:

- OpenGL headers and libraries 
- SDL headers and libraries (I've used version 1.1.7 and 1.2.0)
- gcc (any other ANSI C compiler should do it too; I used gcc 2.96)

Known bugs/issues:

For some odd gluPartialDisk will not display a partial disk. All other
objects work except for this one.
