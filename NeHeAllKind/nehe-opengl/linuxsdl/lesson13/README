Readme for NeHe's OpenGL Tutorial Lesson 13 Linux/SDL port
==========================================================

Compilation:

make

Running:

./lesson13

Requirements:

- OpenGL headers and libraries 
- SDL headers and libraries (I've used version 1.1.7 and 1.2.0)
- gcc (any other ANSI C compiler should do it too; I used gcc 2.96)

Known bugs/issues:

This code does not use SDL to load the fonts. I wasn't quite sure how
this is done. I looked into the SDL_ttf lib, but that's for TrueType
fonts only. If anyone knows how to do this in SDL, I'd be very interested.

If you have any problems, comments, or have useful hints, 
email to leggett@eecs.tulane.edu
