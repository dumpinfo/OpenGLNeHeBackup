Thomas Cunninghammauitom@maui.netFebruary 2008Aloha,This is an upgraded port of the OpenGL lessons on http://nehe.gamedev.net/  for REALbasic. It was tested on RB2007 R5 - OS X. If you are interested in OpenGL and use Rb, these projects should help you get going.Notes:* You should read through the lesson associated with this project on the NeHe site as you read the code in the project. This project does not follow the lesson exactly, but it is close. Many of the code needed for a C type program, given at NeHe site, is not needed in Rb.* This REALbasic download includes two different approaches to using OpenGL directly in Rb.	a) The project named OpenGL Lesson Four is the updated project from ones I did in 2003. This project uses modules and declares to access OpenGL functionality.	b) The second project named OpenGL Lesson Four PlugIn uses the free Rb plugin named OpenGLSurface.rbx. You will need to get a copy of the plugin from Tinrocket, it is free. The URL is,http://www.tinrocket.com/software/openglsurface/Refer to the about box for credits. If you use any of this code, please include the names in the credits window. A lot of time was spent on this plugin, so email John at Tinrocket and thank him for making it available to the Rb community for free. Enjoy.
