        Compiles under Irix using the CC compiler. Just tupe make.
        The code uses GLUT for the dirty work therefore
        it should be easy to port it to any other platform glut supports.
        The texture (rgb) files loading source is taken from the Advanced
        OGL Siggraph 99 source code.  
 
        The texture source code is in texture.c and texture.h
        For using them in your own code:
        The following libs are needed
	LIBS = -lglut -lGLw -lGLU -lGL -lXmu -lXt -lX11 -lm
        
	sample: sample.c texture.h texture.c
		cc $(CFLAGS) -o $@ sample.c texture.c $(LIBS)

	To use the code in your program is easy. First put in
	the header file:

	#include "texture.h"

	Then just make the following call:

	unsigned *teximage; /* pointer to texture data */
	int texwid, texht; /* dimensions of texture that was read */
	int texcomps; /* number of components in external format */

	teximage = read_texture(filepath, &texwid, &texht, &texcomps);

	Now you can load the texture very easily:

	glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, internal_format, texwid, texht, 0,
                    GL_RGBA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, teximage);

       The additional changes made are that a constant explosion and a 
       spin me crazy mode was added.
       Press <e> and <c> respectively to activate and deactivate.(Slick effects :))
       Otherwise the keys functions are the same.
       
       Suggestion, put up trippy music,
       run the program, press <e>, <enter>, <c> (in any order)
       Dream away........
