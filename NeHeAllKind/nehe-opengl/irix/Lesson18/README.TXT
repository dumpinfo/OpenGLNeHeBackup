README for lesson18
===================

The Makefile assumes you have GLUT3.7 installed as follows:

Includes:	/usr/local/include/

Library:	/usr/local/lib/

If your setup is different from this, edit the Makefile accordingly.

Usage...

F1 key toggles fullscreen/window mode

Page Up/PAge Down   -- zoom in/out

Arrows --- rotation

o/O	--- cycle objects
l/L     --- toggle lighting
f/F     --- texmap filters

ESC     --- quick and dirty exit!

and of course, GLUT users get an extra object, the Teapot!

To make simply type "make"

Enjoy.
