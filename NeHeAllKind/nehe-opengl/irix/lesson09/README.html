<blockquote>&nbsp;
<br>This is the SGI port of NeHe's OpenGL tutorial.
<br>Port done by Lakmal Gunasekara 1999.
<br>It's mainly based on the Solaris port of myself which
<br>is based on the linux port from Richard Campbell.
<p>NOTE: You will see that the comments are pretty ugly in the source files.
I had to replace every comment of type //&nbsp;which is C++ style with
/* */&nbsp; which is the original c style. I used perl for this. But because
of the fact that I'm not so good in perl the result doesn't look very good
in human eyes. Nevertheless the C Compiler doesn't care
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>Usage:</b>
<p>make
<p>This will build the tutorial you actually have (lesson1, lesson2...)
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>Hardware requirements:</b>
<p>- A SGI workstation (I've been using an INDY with Vino video graphic
subsystem)
<br>If you have, take something more powerfull.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>Software requirements:</b>
<p><b>Operating system:</b>
<p>- IRIX 5.3 (I don't think you also have such an oldtimer in front of
you)
<p><b>OpenGL:</b>
<p>- The version that's shipped with IRIX should be ok.
<p><b>GLUT:</b>
<p>- GLUT 3.7beta.
<p>GLUT is NOT shipped by SGI.
<p>You can download the precompiled library from:
<p>http://reality.sgi.com/opengl/glut3/glut3.html
<p>But building it by yourself is very easy under IRIX.
<p><b>cc:</b>
<p>- I've used version 3.19 but I think there are newer version out there
( :-/ )
<p>Known bugs:
<p>Probably a lot of...
<p>Contact:
<p>If you have problems, or have useful hints, email me at lakmal@gunasekara.de.
<p>Credits:
<br>Jeff Molofee (nehe@home.com) for writing the tutorials.
<br>Richard Campbell (ulmont@bellsouth.net) for doing the linux port.
