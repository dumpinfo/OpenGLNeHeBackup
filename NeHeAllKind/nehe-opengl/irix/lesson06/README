This is the SGI port of NeHe's OpenGL tutorial.
Port done by Lakmal Gunasekara 1999.
It's mainly based on the Solaris port of myself which
is based on the linux port from Richard Campbell.

NOTE: You will see that the comments are pretty ugly in the source files. I had to replace every comment of type // which is C++ style with /* */  
      which is the original c style. I used perl for this. But because of the fact that I'm not so good in perl the result doesn't look very good in human eyes. 
      Nevertheless the C Compiler doesn't care
-----------------------------------------------------------

Usage:

make 

This will build the tutorial you actually have (lesson1, lesson2...)

-----------------------------------------------------------

Hardware requirements:

- A SGI workstation (I've been using an INDY with Vino video graphic subsystem)
If you have, take something more powerfull.

-----------------------------------------------------------
  
Software requirements:

Operating system:

- IRIX 5.3 (I don't think you also have such an oldtimer in front of you)

OpenGL:

- The version that's shipped with IRIX should be ok.

GLUT:

- GLUT 3.7beta. 

GLUT is NOT shipped by SGI.

You can download the precompiled library from:

http://reality.sgi.com/opengl/glut3/glut3.html

But building it by yourself is very easy under IRIX.

cc:

- I've used version 3.19 but I think there are newer version out there ( :-/ )

Known bugs:

Probably a lot of...
