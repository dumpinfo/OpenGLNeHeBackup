Before you can compile the source in this archive you need to download the headers glext.h and wglext. Because of copyright issues they are not included in this archive.
Have a look at http://www.opengl.org/developers/faqs/technical/extensions.htm 
At the very end (23.090) you'll find the links to these files.

That's all...
