Linux port of NeHe's Lesson 19

I made this Linux port of lesson 19 from NeHe
at approximately 4 AM in vi (of course).  While I'm sure the code
looked great in whatever editor it was originally done in, it looked
pretty awful (tabs and stuff) in vi, so hopefully this will look nice
for all you Linux folk.

WHAT YOU NEED
-------------

Well, obviously you need GL.  Aside from that, all you need is the SDL libraries.
I have 1.1.3.  You can get it at http://www.libsdl.org
It's nice for getting fullscreen stuff kickin with OpenGL (or not, for that matter).
I believe the OpenUT (Unreal Tournament for Linux) project makes use of it.  Oh well,
it's nice.  You'll need it.  Don't forget to add the SDL include path to your include
path or...well...you have to.

WHAT TO DO
----------

I have included a binary which was compiled on my PIII running slackware 7.0.
Not that it matters, it should run on any i386 with GL and SDL >= 1.1.3.
You COULD run that, OR compile the code (duh).  Make sure that you like with
GL, GLU, SDL, and pthread libraries (pthread is used by SDL).  Ex:

gcc lesson19.cc -olesson19 -lGL -lGLU -lSDL -lpthread

Hard, huh?

BTW, props to NeHe...I like this particle system.  It looks hella cool.  Hope y'all enjoy
this port to the world's most wonderful OS there ever was and will be.

Peace,
