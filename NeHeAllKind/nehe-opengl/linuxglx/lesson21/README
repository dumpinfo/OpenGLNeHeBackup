Readme for NeHe's OpenGL Tutorial Lesson21 Linux/GLX port
==========================================================

Compilation:

make

Running:

./lesson21

Requirements:

- OpenGL headers and libraries 
- Xserver with GLX and XF86VidMode extensions (I used version 4.0.1)
- gcc (any other ANSI C compiler should do it too; I used gcc 2.95.2)

Known bugs/issues:

- does not stop drawing even if iconified (though it is not visible)
- does not explicitly select color depth
- sound stuff is *very* simple and does not properly support mixing 2
sounds, playing different formats in one session (resampling and stuff), and
will likely have problems with bigger soundfiles than the effects used in
this example (since we just write the whole stuff to the soundcard in one big
chunk...)

improvements/differences over other ports:
- somehow 10% higher framerate than SDL-port on my machine (do not exactly
know why, but hey, thats nice somehow...)
- effects sound better than with SDL-port but no music
- IMHO much better keyboard control than SDL-port (you can hold the keys down
to keep moving not having to press them for every step/box)
