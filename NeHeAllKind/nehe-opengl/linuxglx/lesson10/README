Readme for NeHe's OpenGL Tutorial Lesson10 Linux/GLX port
==========================================================

Compilation:

make

Running:

./lesson10

Requirements:

- OpenGL headers and libraries 
- Xserver with GLX and XF86VidMode extensions (I used version 4.0.1)
- gcc (any other ANSI C compiler should do it too; I used gcc 2.95.2)

Release Notes:

- keyhandling mostly rewritten for this lesson to make movement smoother. Note
  that we listen for key-release events in this lesson.

Known bugs/issues:

- since we do not perform any timing stuff, the value-changes done through 
  keypresses have to be adjusted to the machine speed to be sensible
- does not stop drawing even if iconified (though it is not visible)
- does not explicitly select color depth
