This lesson is intended for use with the Lightweight Java Game Library(LWJGL).  
You must have version 0.9a installed and configured with your IDE to compile and run.  
For convenience I have also included a batch file described below.

For these programs to run, the LWJGL native library must be available.  
The easiest way to do this is to set an environment variable to point to it.  
I have set up the windows .bat file to use LWJGL_HOME as this variable.  
Set this variable up and the .bat files should run with no problem.

If you experience problems with this, use the following command line argument 
to set the system property with java.exe:

-Djava.library.path=<path to lwjgl library>

I only have a Windows system, so if anyone wants to convert the .bat file to 
other system type files and send it to me, I will include it with the tutorials.  
You can also send me any comments/improvements as well.
