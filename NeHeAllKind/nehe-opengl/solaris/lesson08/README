This is the Solaris port of NeHe's OpenGL tutorial.
Port done by Lakmal Gunasekara 1999.
It's mainly based on the Linux Port from Richard Campbell.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Usage:

make 

This will build the tutorial you actually have (lesson1, lesson2...)
Check if your software installation is ok (see below):

-----------------------------------------------------------

Hardware requirements:

- A SPARC based workstation (up to today Sun didn't port OpenGL on Solaris x86)

- A framebuffer. If possible accelerated. I've tested the examples also on
  non-accelerated framebuffers. They work (but slow).

-----------------------------------------------------------
  
Software requirements:

Hint: Your LD_LIBRARY_PATH should look something like this:

> echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
/usr/lib:/usr/openwin/lib:/usr/dt/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/sparc_solaris/glut-3.7/lib/glut

Otherwise Solaris is not able to find your runtime libraries. This is not a default
YOU have to set it!

Operating system:

- Solaris 7 (I've used Solaris 7 (SUNOS 5.7) maybe it also runs under 2.6 or 2.5.1)
  Install the patches for OpenGL! You find them where you get OpenGL from.

OpenGL:

- OpenGL Version 1.1.2.

(I've used that. The examples should run also on newer versions of OpenGL).

If you don't have it already you may download it from:

http://www.sun.com/solaris/opengl

You need the runtime version (libGL.so...) AND the development version (header files).

But I think OpenGL is shipped with Solaris these days. Look on your CD.

Check to see if everything nessesary is there:

> cd /usr/openwin/lib
> ls libGL*

should print:
libGL.so@     libGLU.so@    libGLw.so@
libGL.so.1*   libGLU.so.1*  libGLw.so.1*

> cd /usr/openwin/include/GL
> ls 

should print:
gl.h          glu.h         glxmd.h       glxtokens.h
glmacros.h    glx.h         glxproto.h

GLUT:

- GLUT 3.7beta. 

GLUT is NOT shipped by Sun. You can download the precompiled source tree from:

http://reality.sgi.com/opengl/glut3/glut3.html#sun

There is a 32bit and a 64bit version. I've used 32bit. This definitly works.
I've installed GLUT in /usr/local. There the makefiles expect the library to find.

OpenWindows (X11 implementation of Sun):

I've used OpenWindows 3.6.1. If you've installed OpenGL for Sun it should also install
the enhancements for the X-Server XSun from Sun.

I've tested these examples on non-OpenGL accelerated framebuffers in Sun workstations.
It worked well (but slow).

gcc:

- gcc 2.8.1.

You can get it from http://www.sunfreeware.com. It's pretty easy to install.

I ran a 64 bit kernel. Compilation was not a problem with this compiler version.

Known bugs:

Non-OpenGL accelerated framebuffers don't like GLUT_ALPHA. Therefore I've deleted
it in the source. 

Changed:

glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_RGBA | GLUT_DOUBLE | GLUT_ALPHA); 

to 

glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_RGBA | GLUT_DOUBLE);
