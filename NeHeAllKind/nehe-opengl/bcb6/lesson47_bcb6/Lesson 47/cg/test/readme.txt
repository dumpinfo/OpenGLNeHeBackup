This is a version build from the VC++ and linux-Version. It compiles under BCB6. 
How to run:
- Install the NVidia Cg Headers and libraries for BCB6 (or Delphi) http://clootie.narod.ru/Projects/nvidia_cg.html
- Use BCB6 to compile the files in this package. If something don´t work look at the paths in the project-options.

Have fun ...
