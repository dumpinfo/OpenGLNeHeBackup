CHANGES
-------

Obviously, there is going to be some changes when a port is done.
Of course, all Windows crap was deleted (FIRST), and then I threw in the SDL
stuff real quick.  Basically, most of the code (at least the controls and
the GL code) went untouched.

You'll notice that Data/Particle.bmp (from the original demo) is now
Particle.raw.  Sure sign of laziness on my part.  I didn't feel like writing
a BMP loader (to replace the one from GLaux) so I converted it to a raw file
with gimp.  Same pic though.

Oh yeah, and if one were to, say, have SDL for Windows, this WOULD (apparently) compile without
needing ANY changes whatsoever.

I like portable code.  It's fun.
