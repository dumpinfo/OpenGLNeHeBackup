NeHe's Lesson 16

SDL port

There's a comment at the beginning of the code with some notes.
BTW, Crate.bmp was converted to a 24-bit BMP, because I didn't feel
like dealing with a color indexed picture ( Hey, at least i didn't
totally change to a RAW file :> ).

WHAT YOU NEED
-------------
SDL (www.libsdl.org)
Some kinda OpenGL implementation ( i.e., NVIDIA_GLX, MesaGL, etc...)

BUILDING
--------
Well, building it really isn't that hard...make sure the include path
is set correctly for SDL ( I include it as "SDL/SDL.h", so... ) and
just build as follows:

cc lesson16.c -o lesson16 -lSDL -lpthread -lGL -lGLU

NOTE: To compile for Windows, you must #define WIN32

That's it.  Enjoy.
