LESSON 09 : Moving bitmap in 3D space

This is (scalp)'s asm conversion of Nehe's opengl tuts.

Masm32 can be found at masm32.cjb.net

OpenGL include files for Masm32 can
could be find at hardcode site :
http://bizarrecreations.webjump.com

Again, we have to use a 24bits bitmap, and not 256 colors one,
so i've include here the "good" version.

If you have any question, mail me at scalp@bigfoot.com
