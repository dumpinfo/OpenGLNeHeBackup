OpenGL include files for Masm32 can
could be find at hardcode site :

The lesson 3 add color to lesson 2.
In the triangle, we use smooth color, in
the quad, we use flat coloring.

Note that this version (and next ones) will
be light, that mean i ripped all error detections.

N.B: please excuse my bad english !
