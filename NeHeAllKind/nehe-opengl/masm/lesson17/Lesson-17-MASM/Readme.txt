- NeHe's Tutorial 17 -

Author: Greg Helps <x86@ozducati.com>
Date: July 30 2003

With thanks to NeHe for the OpenGL tutorials <http://nehe.gamedev.net/>

Inspiration for x86 Assembler from Nico <scalp@bigfoot.com>

OpenGL x86 include files originally from hardcode <http://bizarrecreations.webjump.com> although the site is now offline. 

I've included the OpenGL include files required to compile this as they were dificult to find originally.

Please note: Assembled with MASM32V8 and windows.inc (Version 1.26e)
Both available from <http://www.masmforum.com>

I'm a beginner, any comments / suggestions / questions are welcome.

Great assembler web sites:
