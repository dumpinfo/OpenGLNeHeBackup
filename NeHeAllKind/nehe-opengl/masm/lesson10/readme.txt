LESSON 10 : Building a 3D world

This is (scalp)'s asm conversion of Nehe's opengl tuts.

Masm32 can be found at masm32.cjb.net

OpenGL include files for Masm32 can
could be found at hardcode site :
http://bizarrecreations.webjump.com

Note : The file world.txt should end with a newline.

Also note that i have an ATI card, so i can't test my
OpenGL progs, so if you see any bugs : mail me !

If you find a better way to do all this, please send
me your code at scalp@bigfoot.com.
This can be apply to all tuts !
