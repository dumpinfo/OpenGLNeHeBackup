;from this tut, i use the new include file of Hardcode, so
;this file is different from other tuts.

DM_BITSPERPEL       = 00040000h
DM_PELSWIDTH        = 00080000h
DM_PELSHEIGHT       = 00100000h

_GL_DPUSH_FIX MACRO
 mov eax,eax
 mov ebx,ebx
ENDM

_glClearDepth MACRO t                   ;this is not defined in hardcode's include files
    gl_dpush t                          ;so here it is.
    _GL_DPUSH_FIX
    call glClearDepth
