- NeHe's Tutorial 15 -

Author: Greg Helps <x86@ozducati.com>

With thanks to NeHe for the OpenGL tutorials <http://nehe.gamedev.net/>

Inspiration for x86 Assembler from Nico <scalp@bigfoot.com>

OpenGL x86 include files originally from hardcode <http://bizarrecreations.webjump.com> although the site is now offline. 

I've included the OpenGL include files required to compile this as they were dificult to find originally.

Compiled using MASM32 <http://www.masm32.com>

I'm a beginner, any comments / suggestions / questions are welcome.

Great assembler web sites:
