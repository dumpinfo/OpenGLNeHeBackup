LESSON 07 : texture filters, lighting & keyboard control

This is (scalp)'s asm "light" conversion of Nehe's opengl tuts.

Masm32 can be found at masm32.cjb.net

OpenGL include files for Masm32 can
could be find at hardcode site :
http://bizarrecreations.webjump.com

We will here learn 3 texture filters, keyboard control and lightning !
As NeHe said, you should have understand tut 1 to 6 before trying to
play with this one.
As this version of LoadGLTexture doesn't support 256 color bmp, i use
the 24bits version of nehe's bitmap.

L : turn light off/on
F : change filter (from good to bad texture)
PREVIOUS/NEXT PAGE : zoom in/out
UP/DOWN : inc/decrease x speed
LEFT/RIGHT : inc/decrease y speed
F1 : fullscreen/window mode
