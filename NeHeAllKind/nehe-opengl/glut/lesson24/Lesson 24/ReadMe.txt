Lesson #24 by Jeff Molofee (NeHe)
Ported to GLUT.

My thanks go out to NeHe for helping out the new OpenGL programmers out there.

NOTE: GLUT Game Mode uses 1024x768, 32 bits, 60hz.
If your computer cannot handle this, I won't vouch for glutGameModeGet(GLUT_GAME_MODE_POSSIBLE)'s accuracy in picking that up.
I will be not held liable for any damage, physical or otherwise, this causes to you, your computer, or your pets.
